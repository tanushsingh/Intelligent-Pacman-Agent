# Intelligent-Pacman-Agent

Pacman projects adopted from UC Berkeley CS188 Intro to AI. 
http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html

The project uses various Artificial Intelligence techniques such as different search algorithms, multiagent planning, reinforcement learning, MDP, etc to help pacman complete the game tasks by itself such as finding it's way through the maze, eating all the pellets, avoiding the ghosts,etc.

Sections of the projects covered:

Project 1: Search - DFS, BFS, UCS, Greedy Search and A* Search to help pacman find it's way through the maze and eat all pellets.

Project 2: MultiAgent - minimax, alpha-beta pruning, expectimax

Project 3: Markov Decision Processes & Reinforcement Learning - Value Iteration, Q-learning, Approximate Q-learning

Project 4: Ghostbusters - Hidden Markov Model, Bayes Net, Particle Filtering.
